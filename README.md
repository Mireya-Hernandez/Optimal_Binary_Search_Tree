# Optimal_Binary_Search_Tree

* Algorithm Analysis 

# Structure of Implementation

* In order to run the program a user must enter the desired amount of keys they would want to calculate. Note number of keys that exceed 10000 may not execute due to the limited amount of memory.

* Based on the number entered the code will generate the specified number of random key and sort them. 

* The next step in the code will be to generate random probabailities which is based on the number of keys plus one for the dummy key.

* In the code I ensure to use the PrintWriter so that diffrent txt files can be created to store the output of the input given.

* Then the code for the Optimal binary tree is place which develops the e, w and r matrix
